# Machine Learning Resources

This document lists various resources for learning machine learning on your own.

## Online
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
  - This is a great introductory online course
  - Exposes you to broad range of topics and gives you the big picture
  - Pretty hands on
- https://www.edx.org/course/learning-data-introductory-machine-caltechx-cs1156x
  - This course is a bit more advanced online course
  - The enrollment is now closed
  - Archived version: http://work.caltech.edu/telecourse.html
  - Highly recommended, esp. for those with a mathematical background
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks
- https://www.kaggle.com/
  - Start with the Titanic challenge for ML and Cats vs. Dogs redux for Deep Learning
- https://metacademy.org/
  - Big knowledge graph for machine learning
  - E.g. if you want to learn about [maximum likelihood](https://metacademy.org/graphs/concepts/maximum_likelihood):
    - It will tell you what are the prerequisites
    - Then it will point you to exact places where to study this concept, e.g.:
      - Read these chapters in this book
      - Watch this part of this lecture video
  - This way, you don’t have to read the whole books from cover to cover; you can just learn what you feel like and it will point you to the relevant part of the textbook
  - The best thing about metacademy is its [roadmaps](https://metacademy.org/roadmaps/):
    - They tell you what concepts you need to learn in order to master some larger topic, e.g. [Bayesian Machine Learning](https://metacademy.org/roadmaps/rgrosse/bayesian_machine_learning)
    - You can just follow each topic at your own pace
- https://www.deeplearning.ai/ (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)
  - If you’re feeling brave, also check out Stanford’s CS231 (Computer Vision - some of the best explanations of ConvNets) and CS224n courses (Deep Learning for NLP)
- https://www.edx.org/course/analytics-edge-mitx-15-071x-3
  - Very practical / project-driven course in R

## Practical
- A good walkthrough an entire (and not unusual) data science project, including data cleaning, data visualisation and feature engineering
  - https://ahmedbesbes.com/how-to-score-08134-in-titanic-kaggle-challenge.html
- PyTorch tutorials and docs are good
- Transfer Learning in Keras:
  - https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html
- A curated list of tutorials:
  - https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/05/30/a-curated-list-of-python-tutorials-for-data-science-nlp-and-machine-learning/
http://DataQuest.io
- Good for hands-on Python tutorials
- http://datacamp.com
  - A lot of hands-on courses for R/Python
